                I ‘am 33 y.o. Living in Samara. <br />
								<p class="description_bold-text">
									At the beginning of the year 2022 I decided to become a front-end 
									developer. Not only because of money and high salary but 
									because I love to see how a website become alive. I love the 
									idea of making a good code and see how hieroglyphs (for other people) 
									becomes something visual and you can use it.
								</p>
                My working experience: <br />
                2015 may – 2017 been working in a marketing agency Eureka-M.
                Started as advertising manager. Yandex direct, Google ads.
                Usually we have an average click price at the market. My goal
                was to make it lower. One of our customers was fast growing
                company of metal tile production. My colleague and me did the
                lowest price on market for the lead. After a year I became a
                Head of ADS department. The goals were to save the results we have
                already achieved and make same results for new clients. I was
                leading the team of 4 people. Designer, ads manager, SMM manager and
                SEO manager.
              </p>
              <p>
                In November 2017 I decided to quit and make my own company based
                on my hobby – fingerboards. I’ve been making small skateboards
                for fingers. A very small niche that takes a lot of time and
                investments in it. So I decided to close it.
              </p>
              <p>
                May 2020 – October 2022 Commercial Truck sales manager. Been
                selling ISUZU (Japan) and IVECO (Italy, Spain) trucks. Both
                brands decided to stop working with Russia. In July our company
                sold all the cars we were reserved, and I decided to quit to give
                myself more time to educate in programming.
